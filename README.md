# napi-bind

`napi-bind` is a header-only C++ library that takes advantage of two things:

- C++ can do template deduction
- C functions have relatively simple types

By combining these, `napi-bind` is able to automatically wrap C functions into N-API bindings with minimal fuss, and no external dependencies or libraries.

Note that while this extends to simple C++ functions, `napi-bind` isn't really designed to do more complex wrapping of C++ objects. You might be able to get it to do so with some cleverness, but no guarantees.

If you are looking to create more complex C++ bindings, consider one of the following two libraries:
